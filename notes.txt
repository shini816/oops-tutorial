1. classes n obj-
    class has data/attribute and func/methods
    attributes gets called itself, methods are called manually
2. why python  is called object oriented program
3. end to end project (chatbox class)
4. function vs methods
5. you can create attribute outside class as well
6. encapsulation (additional layer of protection in python is called encapsulation) -
    self__name = "default user" (how to hide attribute)
    how to access the attribute - 
        print(user1._chatbook__name)
7. getter and setter -  
    Getter is a method used to access (read) the value of a class’s private data member.
    Setter is a method used to modify (write) the value of a private data member with validation/control.
    They support encapsulation, one of the core principles of OOP, by restricting direct access to class variables.
8.inheritance -
